A database is a digital system designed for the storage and arrangement of data
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage data

MySQL works like this:

Client Request: You send a request to the MySQL server using an application or a command-line tool.
Connection: The server connects with your application to start a session.
SQL Parsing: The server checks your SQL query for any errors.
Query Optimization: The server figures out the best way to execute your query efficiently.
Execution: The server runs the query. It reads or writes data to the database as needed.
Storage Engine: This is where data is stored on the disk. MySQL uses different storage engines like InnoDB or MyISAM for this.
Result Generation: The server creates the result based on your query.
Response: The server sends the results back to your application.
Client Interaction: Your application displays the data to you.
Transaction Management: For complex operations, MySQL ensures everything runs smoothly and data remains accurate.
Logging and Recovery: MySQL keeps logs to help recover data if something goes wrong.
Replication and Backup: MySQL can copy data to other servers for safety and better performance. It also supports data backups to keep your information safe.
